GETTING ALL MODS FULLY LOADED

Some mods are total conversion, replace everything and don't use the base game free_colonies
Some mods are just additions, adding new data but also using SOME base game data

Each mod needs a modconfig which determines where it's data files are located, which data is relevant, and how the inheritance works

FULL STYLING OVERHAUL
Desktop styling needs to be improved, and mobile styling needs to be done.

DATA LOADING REDESIGN
Data needs to be loaded on a per use basis, to better handle larger datasets as the folders parsed expands
Each mod should have its own data folder, and each type of data should be stored in different files (countries, policies, ideagroups, religiongroups, etc)
Each page should load the data when the page is navigated to

INFRASTRUCTURE
Need to use sass rather than css
Data rework mentioned above
Versioning for source files to bust cache

PARSER IMPROVEMENTS
Idea groups are ordered, we should capture that and use it.
